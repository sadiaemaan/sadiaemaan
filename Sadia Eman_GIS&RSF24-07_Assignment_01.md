**Summary**
With a background in Geographical Information Systems (GIS), I provide a combination of responsibility and organizational skills developed via academic and extracurricular activities. I am looking forward to applying my GIS knowledge to realworld problems in my first professional position.

**Work Experience:**

**GIS intern** 

**WORKING  on  PULSE project at Country Survey and Mapping Services(CSMS)**
| *Lahore* |
* Acre Grid setting according to the Satellite/Drone image.
* Geo-referenced the mussavies using the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
* projection system according to mouza area lies.
* Align geo-reference the mussavies with satellite/drone image.
* Maintaining Raster and Vector data hierarchy.
* Digitize the Required Linear Features According to dimensions on set Acre Grid.
* Individually Create Vector Files of Murabba Grid, Acre Grid, Khasra Grid,
* Dissolve, Mouza Boundary, Dimension, TJ and Corner Points.
* Data Entry in Attribute table according to Requirement or Instructions.

**WORKING  on GIS Sectoral Plans (Kamalia)**

* Used Latest satellite imagery for sectoral planning
* Followed Projected coordinates
* Digitization 
* Parcel mapping used rather than block cutting
* Prepared Topological error free geodatabase for all sectors
* Set Scale 1 inch = 500 meter or less (not more than 500 meter)
* Included updated map of Project following all standards of map elements like Data Frame,
* Legend, Title, North Arrow, Scale etc.
* Used Layout of mapping A1 size (if area of city is large may use A0 size)
* included Accuracy level according to ground truth values.
* Ensured data is collected and maintained in a standardized format
* Provided Topographic data in DEM and Contours form
* Seted symbology of layers with map descriptions


* **Technical Skills:**
  * Programming languages (e.g., Python, Java)
  * Databases (SQL)
  * Data analysis tools (e.g., Excel, ARCGIS, Envi))
